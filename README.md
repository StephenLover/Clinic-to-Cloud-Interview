Hi, this is the code repo for Clinic to Cloud interview, written by Stephen.

### Launch the App

You may install the dependencies first:

Please get into the app folder first, type `cd interview-app`
Please type `npm install` to install dependencies.
Then please type `npm start` to run it on localhost.

### Instruction

According to the specifiction that Clare sent to me, I implemented all functionalities for constructing this form.

Below is a brief introduction that demonstrate what I've done and what I think it still can be improved:

### Acheivement

- Used ES6+ Javascript Syntax to implement features
- Refactor form functionality based on the type of form abstract property, such as "numberInput, selector, textInput" or "optional, required"
- File Structure Applied
- Prettier, naming convention, ESLint(Airbnb style) applied
- Clean code Javascript(https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) style and convention respected
- Design Pattern (Functional Programming Compose) applied
- High Order Function of Javascript applied
- Validation Functionality implemented according to the requirement.
- Error Message Reminder feature implemented.
- Didn't change anything from given JSON file.
- BMI calculation function implemented (but have no idea why the calculated result was a little bit off).
- Work on different form, you may replace the input JSON file in App.js (head circumference and BMI form)
- Did not use any external library.

### Something Can be improved...

## Styling

- Just briefly wrote very few css for styling for features demonstration.
- Personally, I am able to write Scss/Sass for styling and know how to use modern UI framework such as Antdesign and Bootstrap.
- Know how to manage CSS style, such as BEM convention and 7-1 Sass Pattern.
- Partial css3 animation skills could be implemented in this form, such as poped up or spinner.
- Know how to use media query to implement desktop-first/mobile-first responsive web application

## Code Style

- Could be better if could implement more functional programming design pattern, like currying and pipe etc...
- Did not write any test or snapshots.
- Performance can be improve if we can compress CSS, html file by using critial render path optimization strategy, or can use UglifyJS to minify js file.

### Conclusion

<<<<<<< HEAD
First I appreciate that Clinic-to-Cloud can give this opportunity to me, I refactored this code 2-3 times and I think it actually will be better if I can get some precious feedback from the experienced enginners in Clinic-to-Cloud.

Second, I really enjoyed this test and hope that I can get a further discussion for my code and my skill sets.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
